    <h2>Slow Cooked Pulled Pork</h2>
    <p>Slow Cooker Pulled Pork is an easy way to cook the most tender and juicy pork ever. It's great on tacos, sandwiches, burritos and more.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>3 lbs. pork butt</li>
         <li>1 yellow onion, cut into chunks</li>
         <li>4 cloves garlic, roughly chopped</li>
         <li>smoked paprika</li>
         <li>a pinch salt</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Method</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Cut the pork butt into large chunks. If the pork butt has a bone you can either remove it before cooking or wait until you are shredding the cooked meat to remove it. Keep in mind the pork will require extra cooking time if cooking with the bone in.</li>
        <li>Add the pork pieces to a large bowl and sprinkle the spice rub over top. Toss until the pork is evenly coated in spices.</li>
        <li>Dice the yellow onion and add it to the bottom of the slow cooker. Place the seasoned pork on top of the onion, then add the roughly chopped garlic on top.</li>
        <li>Place the lid on the slow cooker and cook on high for four hours or low for eight hours. Test the pork with a fork to make sure the meat is tender. It should shred easily with a fork. If not, cook for one hour longer. The total cooking time will depend on the size of your pork butt.</li>
        <li>Once the pork is tender, use two forks to shred the meat.</li>
        <li>f you prefer crispy edges on your pork, place some of the pork on a sheet pan and broil for a few minutes, or just until the edges are browned and crispy. Keep a close eye on the pork as it broils!</li>
        <li>Serve the pulled pork on sandwiches, tacos, bowl meals, and more!</li>
      </ol>
